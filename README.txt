This is two seperate programs for our final project of CS-5420 Digital Image Processing


-------highlight-------
Highlighting program, the user will open an image using the program and can select an area to highlight and then it will open the newly highlighted image.

-----Usage-----
./highlight @image

-h gives help message
@image - the path to the image desired to be used

Afterwards the user will simply drag a box across the opened image to highlight the selected area.

---------Huffman---------
This program creates huffman encoding for an image and stores it into a text file

-----Usage-----
./huffman @image
-h shows help message
@image - the path to the image desired to be encoded

After running, the Huffman codes for the image will be saved to 'huffman_codes.txt'
